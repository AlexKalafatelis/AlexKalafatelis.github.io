I’m thrilled to announce that our publication, “A Lightweight Predictive Maintenance Strategy for Marine HFO Purification Systems” has been accepted at the <a href="https://emcis.eu/">21st European Mediterranean & Middle Easter Conference on Information Systems (EMCIS)</a>, to be held in Athens, Greece, on September 2-3, 2024.

Our study addresses a critical gap in maritime maintenance by exploring the use of DL models to predict the Remaining Useful Life of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) purification systems. We focus on optimizing these models to fit the computational constraints and cost challenges of maritime vessels, leveraging operational data from industry leader <a href="https://www.laskmar.com/en">Laskaridis Shipping Co. Ltd.</a>

Our findings highlight the potential for predictive maintenance (PdM) systems to enhance vessel reliability and reduce operational costs, making a significant impact on the industry.

Thank you to everyone who supported and contributed to this research. We look forward to sharing our insights and engaging with peers in Athens!
