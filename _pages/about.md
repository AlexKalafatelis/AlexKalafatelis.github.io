Hey there, I'm Alexandros Kalafatelis, a multi-passionate individual with a passion for exploring the realms of technology and innovation.

As a Senior Research Scientist at [Four Dot Infinity](https://fourdotinfinity.com/), and a Researcher at the [Dept. of Ports Management and Shipping of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA)](https://www.pms.uoa.gr/), I am constantly immersed in exciting projects that blend cutting-edge technology and scientific research.

Currently, I am also pursuing my Ph.D. at the Department of Port Management and Shipping of NKUA, where I delve into the exciting domain of Predictive Maintenance for Vessel Machinery. It's an area that merges my passion for Machine Learning and Maritime Security, offering the potential to revolutionize the maritime industry.

My scientific interests are as diverse as my background, spanning Machine Learning, PdM, Edge Computing, Maritime Security & Telecommunications, and Computational Biology. I'm also actively engaged in research projects and have proudly contributed to numerous H2020 & HE initiatives.

If you share a passion for technology, innovation, and making a positive impact on the world, I'd love to connect and collaborate on exciting projects. Let's journey together into the fascinating world of AI, where the possibilities are limited only by our imagination!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
